# Python-Training:
## Day 1
### outcomes:
1-We had and overview of the code editor that will be used i.e VS code , and about the environments.

2-We learned about python basic syntax, data and sequence types including but not limited to int, str, lists, sets and dict

3-We had an overview about the operations that can be applied to different data types inclusing + - * / // and % , for the numebrs (int + float) and strings.

7-We discussed github website to be used as our main platform to uploud our python projects 

8-we briefly discussed the functions in python which yet to be discussed in details tomorrow.

### Exercises: 
1-The Exercises we've solved covered almost all basic operations that can be applied to data types.

2-I have used the materials provided by Hamze and the website https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_join.asp mainly as my source to solve the Exercises .

3-I have used Jupyter notbook to write the code in conda environment.
